# etch-a-sketch
For this project I will be creating a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. Move the mouse over the grid to draw and color anything you want! Feel free to change the grid size and color modes using the buttons above the grid.

This will develop and demonstrate my DOM manipulation skills along with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

After having completed this project, I would like to share some thoughts.
Firstly, I really enjoyed working on this project and seeing it get closer and closer to the finished project after each commit. I feel like I am learning and developing my skills with HTML, CSS, Javascript nicely. There is still much to learn but I am enjoying the process and doing my best to resolve any challenges I face along the way.

I faced a few challenges in which I over complicated the solution. It was helpful to take a step back and plan out and break down the problem step by step. In order to better understand what my code is doing and how to accomplish the functionality I want.

Some things to possibly add in the future:
    -toggle progressive darkening effect
    -color picker
    -eraser mode
